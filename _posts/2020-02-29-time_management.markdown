I love coding at Flatiron, but trying to manage my time has been extremely difficult. I'm a mom, an entrepeneur, and coding student.  the challenges here at Flatiron, trying to keep up with the pace with my cohort has been the hardest. I think one of my side projects will be a react Time Management App. I'm doing very well at school, but struggling a little financially because I'm trying to balance my time between school, work , and my sons activities. I know in the end it will all be worth it, because I'm creating things I never thought I could, and using logic to solve problems. I'm very excited for what the future brings for me . I feel like I've grown a lot over the past ten months. All the struggles that come with student life has been worth it.
