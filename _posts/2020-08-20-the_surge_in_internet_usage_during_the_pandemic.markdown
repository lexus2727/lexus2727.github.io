Like many other Americans since the quarantine began last April, I use the internet more often for daily activities like  work, classes, to schedule appointments, and track information about the pandemic.

Acording to the Pew Research Center, due to the increase in reliance 93% of the Americans surveyed, said they fear major interruption to internet or cellphone service would cause a major problem in their daily life. Many Americans are using digital technology to keep in contact with family, friends, and search for pandemic related information. According  to the Pew Research Center, when asked about a range of activities they have performed in response to the coronavirus outbreak, 76% of Americans said that they use the internet for email or messaging services to communicate with others, while 70% report that they have searched online for information about the coronavirus.

By comparison fewer Americans about 40% say they have shared or posted information about the outbreak on social media.
