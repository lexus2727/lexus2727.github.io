Being a single mom of two teenage boys, as well as a small business owner, I find myself problem solving on a daily basis. It was only natural that I would be attracted to doing something I do best..solving problems! I also have a gentle creative spirit. I practice yoga three times a week and it can be very challenging, as well as spiritually rewarding. In yoga, there is always a higher level to aspire to, which is part of the appeal. Writing, balances me spiritually and allows me to be present in the moment. Coding, like life can be difficult yet rewarding. I find myself thinking in ways I haven't since I was a radiographer. I use perform x-rays in the operating room and trauma unit. So, thinking critically on my feet was part of the daily norm.  Working in trauma the cognitive process is somewhat different than coding, but in someways its the same. During a trauma situation, I have to be prepared to  perform x-rays and CPR whenever asked. I have to be attentive, aware of my surroundings, and perform and develop high quality x-ray films. In trauma, there was no room for error, especially from radiology. I find some similarities between trauma and coding, except the stakes aren't as high of course. I find that coding requires the same amount of professionalism, attention to detail, and like trauma there's no room for error. The cognitive process is somewhat different than coding. In trauma, you think critcially, logically, and you know your limitations. Coding seems like 100% logic. That's something I have to get use to. I have attention deficit disorder, so I process information in pieces and put it together in the order I understand them. Sometimes I feel like I am a second behind others. One thing for sure. It's never stopped from doing anything I wanted to do.
