I built a simple javascript applicationg to live code on my channel <devCandice> on YouTube. Th application allows a user to input tasks and check them off once they've been completed. Once the tasks have been completed the user can view the tasks in section marked "Completed Tasks". Then, the user has the option to delete the tasks permantly. This is done through a function I created called createNewTask. The function takes in a task argument and appends a <li> tag , a <label>and a checkbox to it. The new task is then added to the "Incomplete Tasks" list by be binding the tasks by id.
